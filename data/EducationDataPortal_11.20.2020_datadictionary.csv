"race","Race and ethnicity","There are variations in the way race is defined across years and files. Common Core of Data: The Common Core of Data used five racial categories through 2007 and has used seven categories since 2008. Civil Rights Data Collection: In the Civil Rights Data Collection, the race variable is consistently defined throughout all years. Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System: Before 2007, the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) used only the ""old"" racial or ethnic categories, and after 2009, IPEDS used only the ""new"" racial or ethnic categories. In IPEDS between 2007 and 2009, institutions could use the old categories, the new categories, or a mix of both to report completions data. The six old categories wereÂ  American Indian or Alaska Native; Asian or Pacific Islander; black, non-Hispanic; Hispanic; white, non-Hispanic; and nonresident alien. The eight new categories were American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, black or African American, Hispanic or Latino, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, white, two or more races, and nonresident alien. For these years, we used the IPEDS-derived options for the following instances: Asian/Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander; American Indian or Alaska Native; Hispanic or Latino/Hispanic; black or African American/black, non-Hispanic; and white/white, non-Hispanic.
